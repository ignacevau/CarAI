# CarAI
Cars learn to drive a custom created track.

<h3><b>Track Generator</b></h3>
<i>Create a custom track which the cars will learn to drive</i>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>1. Draw the inner wall of the track
<li>2. Draw the outer wall of the track
<li>3. Set the checkpoints for the track : The amount of checkpoints a car collects decides how well it performs
<li>4. Set the start point : Where will the cars spawn every new generation

<li><b>5. Export the track</b>
<p>- Click the export button once the track is finished</p>
<p>- Go to the 'Car Simulation' folder and replace the 'Track.json' with the new exported JSON file</p>
<p>- You can import this track in the generator again by pressing the import button</p>
</ul>

<h3><b>Car Simulation</b></h3>
<i>Cars get trained using a genetic neural network to improve every generation</i>
