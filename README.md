Cars learn to drive a custom created track.

<i>You can create a custom track which the cars can learn to drive by opening the 'index.html' file
in the 'Track Generator' directory and replacing the current 'Track.json' file in the 'Car Simulation'
folder with the newly exported 'Track.json' file.</i>
